# Change log

## [2.0.0] - 2018-08-13

### Removed

- Remove support for older Ruby releases that are no longer officially supported. The gem might still work, but we'll only target Rubies listed on https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ going forward as official supported target versions.

[2.0.0]: https://github.com/koppen/csv_query/compare/v1.0.4...v2.0.0

## [1.0.4] - 2015-01-10

### Fixed

- Actually take user supplied options like `delimiter` and `select` into account instead of always overriding them with the defaults.

[1.0.4]: https://github.com/koppen/csv_query/compare/v1.0.3...v1.0.4
